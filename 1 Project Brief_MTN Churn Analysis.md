# Project Brief: MTN Nigeria Customer Churn Analysis (Q1 2025)
## Business Context
Customer churn remains a critical challenge for telecom operators, particularly in highly competitive markets such as Nigeria. For MTN Nigeria, understanding which customer segments are most likely to churn, and under what conditions, is essential for improving retention, protecting revenue, and guiding targeted intervention strategies.
This project seeks to analyze customer behavior and churn patterns within MTN Nigeria’s subscriber base during Q1 2025, with a focus on device usage, subscription plans, customer tenure, satisfaction levels, geographic distribution, and revenue contribution.
## Project Objective
The objective of this analysis is to identify churn patterns and risk segments within MTN Nigeria’s customer base and translate these findings into actionable, data-driven retention strategies.

Specifically, the project seeks to:

•	Examine churn distribution across subscription plans, device types, customer tenure, and geographic locations

•	Assess the revenue implications of churn, including the impact of high-value customer loss

•	Evaluate relationships between churn and customer attributes such as satisfaction, usage behavior, and demographics

•	Generate practical recommendations to support customer retention and revenue optimization
## Analytical Scope
The analysis is based on a dataset of 974 customer records representing MTN Nigeria subscribers between January and March 2025. The dataset captures customer demographics, subscription details, usage behavior, revenue metrics, and churn outcomes.

The scope of the analysis includes:

•	Descriptive statistical analysis to summarize customer characteristics and churn behavior

•	Distribution analysis to identify high-churn segments and periods

•	Correlation analysis to explore relationships among key variables without implying causation

•	Insight generation and strategic recommendations aligned with business decision-making
## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project, MTN Nigeria Customer Churn & Usage Dataset (2025), was designed to reflect realistic telecom customer behavior.

•	Device types, data plan names, and pricing were sourced from the MTN Nigeria eShop (Q1 2025).

•	Customer records, usage patterns, and churn indicators were synthetically generated for analytical and educational purposes, with assistance from ChatGPT (OpenAI).
## Expected Business Value
This project provides MTN stakeholders with:

•	Clear visibility into churn-prone customer segments

•	Early indicators of revenue risk linked to customer attrition

•	Evidence-based guidance for targeted retention initiatives

•	A structured analytical framework that can be extended to predictive modeling or dashboard-driven monitoring
## Deliverable
•	A consolidated Excel workbook containing cleaned data, statistical analysis, distribution summaries, dashboards, insights, and recommendations
