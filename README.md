# MTN Nigeria Customer Churn Analysis (Q1 2025)
## Transforming Telecom Data into Actionable Retention Strategies
This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of MTN Nigeria’s subscriber churn patterns for Q1 2025. Using Excel-based statistical analysis and pivot-driven reporting, 974 customer records were analyzed to uncover churn trends and generate data-driven insights to support retention and revenue optimization strategies.

## Key Insights
- Churn is highest among Monthly Plan and Mobile SIM users, peaking in February 2025, with notable concentrations in Abuja, Imo, Kebbi, Yobe, and Benue.
- Most churned customers are low-value, although the loss of high-value customers presents a potential revenue risk.
- Both new and long-tenured customers experience churn, indicating retention challenges across the customer lifecycle.
- Lower-priced plans account for the majority of churned accounts, while some higher-value plans are also affected.
- No single factor demonstrates a strong relationship with churn; patterns across demographics, satisfaction, and usage are generally weak, suggesting the influence of multiple contributing factors.
