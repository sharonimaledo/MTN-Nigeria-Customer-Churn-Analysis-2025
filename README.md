# MTN Nigeria Customer Churn Analysis (Q1 2025)
## Transforming Telecom Data into Actionable Retention Strategies
This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of MTN Nigeria’s subscriber churn patterns for Q1 2025. Using Excel-based statistical analysis and pivot-driven reporting, 974 customer records were analyzed to uncover churn trends and generate data-driven insights to support retention and revenue optimization strategies.

## Key Insights
- Churn is highest among Monthly Plan and Mobile SIM users, peaking in February 2025, with notable concentrations in Abuja, Imo, Kebbi, Yobe, and Benue.
- Most churned customers are low-value, although the loss of high-value customers presents a potential revenue risk.
- Both new and long-tenured customers experience churn, indicating retention challenges across the customer lifecycle.
- Lower-priced plans account for the majority of churned accounts, while some higher-value plans are also affected.
- No single factor demonstrates a strong relationship with churn; patterns across demographics, satisfaction, and usage are generally weak, suggesting the influence of multiple contributing factors.

## Tool Used
Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, descriptive statistical analysis, distribution summaries, and dashboard development.

## Methodology 
- Data Preparation: Verified data types, removed duplicates, standardized categorical values, and corrected inconsistencies to ensure data reliability.
- Churn-Focused Filtering: The dataset was intentionally filtered to include only customers with “Yes” in the Customer Churn Status field. Records marked “No” (active customers) were excluded to align the analysis strictly with churn behavior.
- Descriptive Statistics: Comprehensive summary statistics (including measures of central tendency, dispersion, and distribution shape) were computed for key variables such as age, tenure, pricing, satisfaction, and usage.
- Correlation Analysis: Correlation analysis was performed to examine relationships between numerical variables, including revenue, unit price, tenure, satisfaction, and usage metrics.
- Reporting and Visualization: Pivot tables and an Excel dashboard were used to summarize patterns to communicate key findings and generate actionable recommendations for subscription optimization and customer retention.
